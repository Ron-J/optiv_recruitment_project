    **Example 1:**

    **File Description:**
    Access Card Reader

    A person is holding an access card against a card reader mounted near a door labeled "211 IDF/Electrical." The card reader has a light indicator.

    **Key Findings:**
    - Digital access control system using ID/employee cards.
    - Automates entry tracking by time-stamping when the card is swiped.
    - Dependent on card validity and system integrity (e.g., cards can be lost or borrowed).

    ---
    **Example 2:**

    **File Description:**
    Biometric Attendance/Access System

    A wall-mounted electronic biometric device with fingerprint scanning, keypad, and display screen showing time.

    **Key Findings:**
    - Uses biometric authentication (fingerprint) for high security.
    - Eliminates risks of proxy entry or shared access (unlike cards or logbooks).
    - Provides accurate, automated attendance and access logs.
    - Suitable for organizations seeking reliable and tamper-proof entry systems.

    **Example 3:**

    **File Description:**
    Visitors Logbook

    A paper-based visitor logbook where individuals manually write their name, reason for visit, time in/out, and provide a signature. Two entries are already filled in.

    **Key Findings:**
    - Manual entry system, dependent on handwriting.
    - Prone to errors, illegible writing, and falsification.
    - No automatic time trackingâ€”relies on honesty and accuracy of the visitor.
